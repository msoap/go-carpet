To view the test coverage in the terminal, just run `go-carpet`.

It works outside of the `GOPATH` directory. And it works recursively for multiple packages.

With `-256colors` option, shades of green indicate the level of coverage.

By default skip vendor directories (Godeps,vendor), otherwise use `-include-vendor` option.

The `-mincov` option allows you to specify a coverage threshold to limit the files to be displayed.

Usage
-----

    usage: go-carpet [options] [paths]
      -256colors
        	use more colors on 256-color terminal (indicate the level of coverage)
      -args string
        	pass additional arguments for go test
      -file string
        	comma-separated list of files to test (default: all)
      -func string
        	comma-separated functions list (default: all functions)
      -include-vendor
        	include vendor directories for show coverage (Godeps, vendor)
      -mincov float
        	coverage threshold of the file to be displayed (in percent) (default 100)
      -summary
        	only show summary for each file
      -version
        	get version

For view coverage in less, use `-R` option:

    go-carpet | less -R
