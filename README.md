To view the test coverage in the terminal, just run `go-carpet`.

It works outside of the `GOPATH` directory. And it works recursively for multiple packages.

With `-256colors` option, shades of green indicate the level of coverage.

By default skip vendor directories (Godeps,vendor), otherwise use `-include-vendor` option.

The `-mincov` option allows you to specify a coverage threshold to limit the files to be displayed.

Usage
-----

    usage: go-carpet [options] [paths]
      -256colors
            use more colors on 256-color terminal (indicate the level of coverage)
      -args arguments
            pass additional arguments for go test
      -enforce
            fail if any file's coverage is below mincov
      -file files
            comma-separated list of files to test (default: all)
      -func functions
            comma-separated functions list (default: all functions)
      -include-vendor
            include vendor directories for show coverage (Godeps, vendor)
      -mincov float
            coverage threshold of the file to be displayed (in percent) (default 100)
      -summary
            only show summary for each file
      -version
            get version

For view coverage in less, use `-R` option:

    go-carpet | less -R

As a pre-commit hook
--------------------

[Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) is a tool that makes it easy to run checks on every Git commit.
You can use `go-carpet` as a pre-commit hook by installing pre-commit and including the following
in your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```
repos:
  ...
  - repo: https://github.com/msoap/go-carpet
    rev: v1.11.0
    hooks:
      - id: go-carpet
```

By default, `go-carpet` will enforce 50% test coverage on every changed file.  You can customize
the threshold in your hook with an arguments block as follows:

```
args:
  - "-mincov=X"
```

You must have `go-carpet` installed in your PATH for this pre-commit hook to work.
